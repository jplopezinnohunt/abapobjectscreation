# Session #060 Retro — Payment E2E flow diagram redesign (UX-only, single companion)

**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Duration:** single session, ad-hoc (no start plan, no `.session_state.json` bump)
**Focus:** Fix readability and layout of `companions/payment_bcm_companion.html` — the UNESCO Payment End-to-End flow diagram. Pure rendering-layer work: no SAP data, no brain knowledge, no new domains.

---

## Phase 0 — Closure math

No `session_plans/session_060_plan.md` and no start-phase `.session_state.json` (the file still carries session 049's state). Session was user-driven iteration on a screenshot, not a planned deliverable cycle.

- `items_shipped` = 0 (no PMO/brain items touched)
- `items_added` = 0
- `net_closure` = 0 (neutral — session is reactive UX work, not tracker-driven)

**Justification for running without a plan:** user brought screenshots of a companion diagram for immediate feedback-loop refinement. Planning overhead would have exceeded the work. Explicit N/A per session-end.md §"Minimum Viable Session Close" — retro + verification + commit covers it.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Plan-vs-Retro diff

No plan existed. Every change in this session maps to a verbatim user instruction in the conversation:
1. Initial node-size bump (user: "nodes are too small") → widthConstraint/heightConstraint raised, fitView added.
2. Min-zoom fix (user: "still too small") → forced `minZoom: 1.0`, manual left-anchor positioning.
3. Snake layout request (user: "redesign into 2–3 rows wrap") → explicit `snakePositions` map, fixed {x,y}, `hierarchical` layout disabled.
4. Readability pass (user: "font 14 bold, 160×70, edge pills, reposition Method O, 2px stroke") → all six sub-items applied.
5. Exact-coordinate spec (user: "apply these X/Y, do not interpret") → 19 coordinates replaced verbatim; canvas height bumped 680→760.
6. Wider-spacing + 8 specific edge labels + arrow color spec → coordinates updated again; `edgeLabels` map + `altPathEdges` color map introduced.
7. Final React-Flow-vocabulary spec (labelBgPadding, smoothstep, sourceHandle, EdgeLabelRenderer) → applied vis-network approximations and **explicitly flagged the library gap** for the first time.

No scope creep. No deferred items.

## 1. What the session delivered

Single file touched: **`companions/payment_bcm_companion.html`**

- Replaced `hierarchical: LR` layout with explicit `snakePositions` map: 19 nodes across 3 rows (y=200, 580, 940) + 2 fork offsets (y=30, 370) + 2 branch offsets (Method O y=370, Direct Pay y=760). Fork (Certifying Officer / Group Validator) preserved at same X column with split Y.
- Node styling: `widthConstraint: 180`, `heightConstraint: { minimum: 80, valign: 'middle' }`, bold labels via `multi: true` + programmatic `<b>` wrap, font 15 white centered, margin 14.
- Edge routing: `smooth: { enabled: false }` (straight grid-aligned lines — closest vis-network match for "smoothstep" orthogonal).
- Edge labels: 8 badges above the line via `font.align: 'top'` + `vadjust: -12`, background `#0d1b2a`, color `#add8e6`, size 11 bold. All 12 other edges rendered unlabeled.
- Edge color convention: solid `#4fc3f7` for main flow (17 edges); dashed `#90a4ae` for conditional paths (3 edges: `1→19` Method O, `10→18` Direct Pay alt, `18→14` Direct→SWIFT).
- Viewport: `fit()` + `scale × 0.80` = `fitView({ padding: 0.1 })` equivalent; `minZoom: 0.4`; auto-refit on resize.
- Canvas height grown 520 → 760 px to accommodate the new Y range (30 → 940).
- **Data arrays (`nodes_data`, `edges_data`) untouched.** All styling (bold wrapping, label overrides, dash flags, color overrides) derived in the `DataSet.map()` transform. Honors the user's early "do not change the data" directive.

## 2. Memory / Brain updates

- `~/.claude/projects/c--Users-jp-lopez-projects-abapobjectscreation/memory/feedback_flow_diagram_react_flow_vocab.md` — new feedback memory. User writes process-flow diagram specs in React Flow vocabulary (`labelStyle`, `smoothstep`, `sourceHandle`, `fitView({padding})`, `EdgeLabelRenderer`); current companions use vis-network which can't natively match. **Next session rule:** flag the library gap at the first React-Flow-flavored spec, offer migration path, stop silently approximating.
- `MEMORY.md` index updated with one-line pointer to the new feedback memory.

No brain_v2 update. No SAP object/claim/rule/incident/domain touched.

## 3. Pending (next session)

Not in PMO — flagged here for visibility only:
- **Replicate refined aesthetic** to `p2p_process_mining.html` and `payment_process_mining.html` (both already use vis-network, both have the same tiny-node issue this session started with).
- **Add an E2E flow diagram** to `bank_statement_ebs_companion.html` — currently only ASCII `<pre>` flows, no graph.
- **Scaffold an H2R companion** — no HCM end-to-end companion exists; `py_finance_wage_type_companion_v1.html` covers wage types only.
- **Optional: port `payment_bcm` flow block to React Flow** — would let future iterations use the user's natural spec vocabulary 1:1 and could be extracted as a reusable template across the above three targets. ~1h per diagram if migrated.

## 4. SAP learnings captured (Phase 4b, mandatory)

**N/A for this session.** Justification: pure UX/rendering refinement on an existing companion's diagram block. No new SAP tables, transactions, fields, BAdIs, processes, incidents, or operational behavior surfaced. No interaction with D01, P01, Gold DB, or brain artifacts. Explicit N/A per CLAUDE.md §"Session close — Phase 4b": empty + one-sentence justification, not silent omission.

## 5. Verification Check (Step 2 — Principle 8)

**Challenged assumption:** I applied the user's edge label `"LAUFI≠0/TM"` verbatim to the existing edge `10→18` (DMEE → Direct Pay). The user described this edge as "BCM Batch → Direct Pay".

**What I did NOT check:** the semantic correctness of the label itself. Original `edges_data` has `10→18` labeled `"LAUFI=0/T/M"` — i.e. Direct Pay is taken when LAUFI prefix **IS** 0/T/M. The user's revised label inverts this: `"LAUFI≠0/TM"` means "LAUFI is NOT 0/T/M", which is the **BCM condition** (LAUFI=B*), not the Direct Pay condition.

**Probed claim result:** ⚠ **Label likely semantically inverted.** Two possibilities:
1. User typo — intended `"LAUFI=0/TM"` (matches original data, matches Direct Pay semantics).
2. User intentional — wants the label to describe the condition that **excludes** BCM (which, written as a negation, does route to Direct Pay; but the convention in the original data uses positive form on each branch).

**Action for next session:** verify with user. Do not silently "correct" the label; `edgeLabels['10->18']` in the HTML currently renders `"LAUFI≠0/TM"` as specified. Flagging rather than auto-fixing per CP-003 (precision, evidence, facts — don't approximate when verification is cheap).

**Second challenge — unverified rendering:** the `font.align: 'top'` + `vadjust: -12` approximation for "labels off the line" was not visually confirmed in a browser this session. Next interaction with the user should include a screenshot check; if labels still sit on top of the edge line, the combination is insufficient and needs `multi: true` label wrapping to split into block format, or a migration to a library with native off-line label positioning.

## 6. Promote to Central?

- ⏳ **Candidate:** the React-Flow-vocabulary-vs-vis-network observation, if flow-diagram work recurs across ≥2 more companions, qualifies for the 3× rule and should be promoted to `ecosystem-coordinator/ecosystem/priority-actions.md` as a proposal to standardize on a single process-flow graph library.
- **Not promoting this session** — single instance (only `payment_bcm_companion.html` touched); needs two more observations (e.g. when replicating to p2p/payment_process_mining) before the rule is durable.
- Pre-step 4-locus search not run this session since no central edit is being made.

## 7. Commit scope

One file on disk changed by this session: `companions/payment_bcm_companion.html`. Other modified files in the working tree (`brain_v2/*`, `.agents/skills/hcm_domain_agent/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/sap_fiori_extension_architecture/SKILL.md`) are carryover from prior sessions and are **not** part of this commit — scoping narrowly to avoid mixing unrelated work.

Memory files live outside the repo (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) and are not git-tracked here.
